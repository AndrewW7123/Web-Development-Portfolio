                <h1>Journal #1</h1>
                <p>Jan 14, 2025</p>
                <p>This is the first journal for 1XD3. I am greatly enjoying this course so far, 
                    only being a couple weeks in and the reason being that I've always been interested 
                    in web development. I do have some prior experience in web development through a javasript 
                    course in which I used Brackets to code a mini zombie shooter game and was able to play it 
                    through the web. Outside of this, I have only done small amounts of independent research on 
                    languages like HTML and CSS, so this course introduces new concepts for me, which is exactly 
                    what I wanted since HTML is a backbone of the web. I am looking forward to learning more in the 
                    coming weeks!</p>

                <h2>Journal #2</h2>
                <p>Jan 26, 2025</p>
                <p>This is the second journal for 1XD3. I am quite happy with the way the course has been progressing.
                    I've learned a lot about web development techniques and fundamentals and I feel a lot more 
                    confident now in my ability to develop websites from scratch or search for issues. My first portfolio
                    draft looked just okay, it was nothing special, but I am much happier with this updated layout and
                    colour scheme, although simple. It could certainly use some more professional design analysis 
                    but that is not my specialty, so the focus is on functionality and ease of navigation, which I 
                    believe I nailed down. I'm looking forward to JavaScript and animating my websites next!</p>

                <h2>Journal #3</h2>
                <p>Feb 4, 2025</p>
                <p>This is the third journal for 1XD3. Client-sided programming with HTML, CSS and JavaScript so far 
                    has been very informative just in how it differs from coding programs in Python for example. Web
                    development is a much different process from the programming I have done to this point. I am really
                    enjoying this kind of work, however, and my knowledge of Python and general programming understanding
                    has helped me get straight into JavaScript. The most surprising things about JavaScript so far is just
                    how flexible it is, whether or not that is taken as a benefit. Things like the '===', which is a surefire
                    type and value checker, arithmetic with strings and several other unconventional aspects of the language
                    that certainly clash with my previous understanding of general programming practice. This is arguably
                    the hardest part about the language, though overall, the it's a straight forward language and is very
                    useful for my web development purposes. I look forward to the next stages of the course!</p>

                <h2>Journal #4</h2>
                <p>Feb 25, 2025</p>
                <p>This is the fourth journal for 1XD3. A lot of new progress has been made in my web development skillset
                    and I am really enjoying the JavaScript side of client-sided programming. I have previous knowledge and 
                    skills in object-oriented programming with Python, so using that here with classes and objects in web
                    development is a huge help. So far, classes and objects are the easiest to work with in addition to local
                    storage and DOM manipulation. I find them all fairly intuitive and straight forward. The canvas is the
                    harder portion of the course I've encountered so far. The canvas has specific organization that must be 
                    followed to function properly and drawing geometry also takes a surprising amount of time and careful thought.
                    It is very easy to mess up a shape due to relative drawing methods like lineTo(), but it pays off in the end. 
                    Overall, I'm very happy with the way the course is going right now and I'm looking forward to the server-side!</p>

                <h2>Journal #5</h2>
                <p>March 11, 2025</p>
                <p>This is the fifth journal for 1XD3. Now that I'm gaining skills in the server-side of web development,
                    I have to say I find client-side more rewarding, particularly because of the amount of JavaScript that
                    can go into client side web apps. PHP is very similar in some ways to JavaScript, but it doesn't feel
                    nearly as rewarding to get a server app going as opposed to putting a ton of effort into a game or large
                    client side app that relies heavily on JavaScript event-driven programming. I think the most important role
                    of server-side scripting is the separation of concerns element, especially when we eventually get into databases
                    and being able to delegate certain tasks to specific web pages that all share information with the databases.
                    On the client side, I think the presentation and functionality together make up the most important element as 
                    the overall feel of a website in general makes a huge difference in visitor appeal and genuinely viable websites. 
                    This is a nice way to ride out the last month or so of this term and I'm excited to get going on databases!</p>

                <h2>Journal #6</h2>
                <p>April 1, 2025</p>
                <p>This is the sixth and final journal for 1XD3. I am now able to say this has been my favourite course out of the 
                    courses I've taken in 1st year CS at Mac! I really enjoy the project-based approach to this course as it gives me 
                    time to be meticulous about my programs and I am more easily able to get fundamental hands-on experience with the 
                    languages taught in this course. To date, the most notable skills I've taken away are: getting an introductory 
                    understanding for full stack web development by working with both front end, back end, client side and server side 
                    concepts, expanding my knowledge on programming languages giving me multiple tools for various needs, and in general,  
                    continuing my overall development as an up-and-coming computer scientist! This is absolutely an avenue I can see myself 
                    pursuing in the future given how much time I spent in some of these projects when compared with my other course projects. 
                    I am primarily interested in cybersecurity which goes hand-in-hand with web development, so if I can merge those two paths, 
                    this would be my first choice in a future career surrounding computer science. Thanks to Professor Scott and my TA, John, 
                    for all the help in building up my skills in 1XD3, it has been a fantastic experience!
