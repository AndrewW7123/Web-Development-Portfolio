                <h1>Individual Lab #1</h1>
                <p>Jan 14, 2025</p>
                <p>This week's individual lab consisted of introducing how to setup our very first webpages 
                    which will be developed into good looking portfolio pages for the course. Also learned about 
                    importing those sites into FileZilla, where people on the McMaster network can view them.
                    Also learned how to password protect files and good practices for working with FileZilla.</p>

                <h1>Team Lab #1</h1>
                <p>Jan 16, 2025</p>
                <p>This first team lab consisted of lab students creating groups of four to have a web development
                    team for the rest of the term. A small report was written up to confirm the members of the group
                    and establish various details about the team; team name, slogan, members and website link. Each
                    team also created these simple websites that will be developed for the rest of the term.</p>

                <p>Jan 21, 2025</p>
                <p>This second individual lab involved further developing the style of the portfolio webpages
                    given that we had more understanding on how to style websites better using CSS stylesheets.

                <h1>Team Lab #2</h1>
                <p>Jan 23, 2025</p>
                <p>This second team lab involved teams researching together to find examples of websites that
                    poorly abide by the general principles of good web design and those that efficiently implement
                    them. A small report was made to explain why those sites were or weren't good examples of web design
                    principles and possibly what could be done to improve those pages in the future.
